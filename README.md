          <h3>Tower of Hanoi with Pictorial Assistance</h3>
          <p>
This is a pictorial solution of the famous old problem called 'Tower of Hanoi'<br>
Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks.<br>
The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod,<br>
obeying the following simple rules:<br><ol>
          <li>Only one disk can be moved at a time.</li>
          <li>Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks<br>
and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved
if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.</li>
<li>No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.
The thing added is pictorial assistance of the modification done to the rods, which effectively helps solving the problem.</li></ol>
The Rods with 3 disc is depicted as
