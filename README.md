# MyPersonalProjects
Projects  or code that I like to play around with. This helps me learn and understand new stuff.

Few of my projects have been included here:

  * ## Pure Python
    1. ### Tic Tac Toe
    <pre>Board :   
        0  X  0   
        -  X  -   
        X  -  0 </pre>  
   2. ### Tower of Hanoi with Pictorial Assistance
      This is a pictorial solution of the famous old problem called 'Tower of Hanoi'    
      Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks.    
      The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod,  
      obeying the following simple rules: </p> 
        1.  Only one disk can be moved at a time.
        2.  Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
        3.  No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk. The thing added is pictorial assistance of the modification done to the rods, which effectively helps solving the problem.

       <pre>The Rods with 3 disc is depicted as
			
				               _|_   	    |    	    |
				              __|__  	    |    	    |
				             ___|___ 	    |    	    |
				            =========	=========	=========
				                A           B               C</pre>
